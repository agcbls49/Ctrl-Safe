DO NOT MODIFY THE STYLING UNLESS YOU'RE WILLING TO TORTURE YOURSELF WITH 
TAILWIND CSS BECAUSE ITS ALREADY MOBILE RESPONSIVE AND THE ONLY THING 
WORTH CHANGING WOULD BE THE COLORS. IF YOU WISH TO MODIFY THE STYLING, 
THEN LEARN AND USE TAILWIND INSTEAD OF CSS FOR CONSISTENCY.

I HAVE PUT COMMENTS ON THE RESULTS PAGE FOR COLORS TO USE DEPENDING ON
THE RESULT OF THE MACHINE LEARNING MODEL. THIS IS THE EXACT CONTENT OF 
THE COMMENTS:
<!-- use class="text-green-600" for green color
and use class="text-red-600" for red color
-->
